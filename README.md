# Riana van Niekerk Run and Walk for Bibles

## Welcome!
You my dear friend have stumbled upon a humble repository, something found in a slice of time so thin that it is as if it 
never existed. As a matter of fact, this repository may likely never be reviewed by another pair of eyes other than the developer. 
But you know what? That is ok, since this repo serves its purpose, to bring glory to Jesus, to help spread Bible all over the
world!

Feel free to explore around, I will try and add many comments. If you have any question shoot me a email at: wh.meiring@gmail.com

## Want to contribute?
Great to hear! Simply fork the repo and create a pull request of your changes. Not sure where to start? Look at the issues board,
there might just be something for you there.

## Current development plan (2017 - 2018)
1) Switch design over to a CMS platform like Grav or Kirby, or even to the SSG Hugo
2) Add material theme to it
3) Convert it to a web app if possible
4) Add P5.js dynamics to the website
